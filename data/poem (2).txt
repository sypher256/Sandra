BAKING A POEM
Remember , you must mix , mix, mix,
Every memory and emotion,
Find the things you couldn't fix,
The heart break and deuction,


And them slowly to the batter,
Watch them swirl into something new,
And the mixture that was flater,
With heat , will rise , as poems do,


Remember you must wait,
Until the poem begins to coil,
Before you ice it up
With the thing you learnt in school.


At the centre of your cake ,
Is a secret sweet surprise-
The poems that you will make
Contain your truth, just in disguise
