<span>To taste a poem</span>
One big
Bite!
Slurp!
Gulp it in!
Chew!
Dose the juice run down your chain?
do the flavours make fireworks within you,
Does it work its way into your brain,
Shoot up the back of your nose?
Is there the taste of lemon zest.
or does it just explode ?
Or does the flavour move slowly,
Speak to you alone,
Curl up in your chest,
Does it taste like home ?
