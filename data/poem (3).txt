Poem Under a Magnifying Glass
Its the gentle beating of your heart,
The summary of glee,
The inner contents of your soul ,
The poet you want to be.


Ten words , scratched out,
to chose the perfect one
A very quiet.
A knot that's been undone.


Your mother's laugh.
A happy cry,
A life that's just begun,
The memory of a special day,
A prize that's to be won.


A poem is only words and heart,
A whisper of a song
The poet you wanted to be at the start
Is the poet you were all along
