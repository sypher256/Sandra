        Title: "To taste a poem",
        Poem:`
One big
Bite!
Slurp!
Gulp it in!
Chew!
Dose the juice run down your chain?
do the flavours make fireworks within you,
Does it work its way into your brain,
Shoot up the back of your nose?
Is there the taste of lemon zest.
or does it just explode ?
Or does the flavour move slowly,
Speak to you alone,
Curl up in your chest,
Does it taste like home ?`,

        Title:"BAKING A POEM",
        Poem:`
Remember , you must mix , mix, mix,
Every memory and emotion,
Find the things you couldn't fix,
The heart break and deuction,


And them slowly to the batter,
Watch them swirl into something new,
And the mixture that was flater,
With heat , will rise , as poems do,


Remember you must wait,
Until the poem begins to coil,
Before you ice it up
With the thing you learnt in school.


At the centre of your cake ,
Is a secret sweet surprise-
The poems that you will make
Contain your truth, just in disguise"`,

        Title:"Poem Under a Magnifying Glass",
        Poem:`
Its the gentle beating of your heart,
The summary of glee,
The inner contents of your soul ,
The poet you want to be.


Ten words , scratched out,
to chose the perfect one
A very quiet.
A knot that's been undone.


Your mother's laugh.
A happy cry,
A life that's just begun,
The memory of a special day,
A prize that's to be won.


A poem is only words and heart,
A whisper of a song
The poet you wanted to be at the start
Is the poet you were all alon

        Title:"The Sheherd dreams",
        Poem:`
        Down air crisp
        She pulls her blanket close gainst the cpld;
        The flock mumbling at her knees.

        Sun slices above the hills,
        And floods the with light.
        sheep shfit and mutter in the breeze.

        A lamb strys,
        She guides it to the ewe,
        The flock settles undre her care,

        She unwraps her food.
        The suckers:
        Breakfast together in  cool morning air.

        she dreams .
        of city life ,
        of cars and bars
        And phones , and clothes nd busy streets.
         
        The sun warm ,
        The grazing green,
        And paradise lies at her feet
